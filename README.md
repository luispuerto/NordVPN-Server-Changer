# Change NordVPN Server Command

This is a small script that creates a command to easily change the NordVPN Server on OpenVPN. 

It basically does 3 commands. 

1. It copy the desired NordVPN configuration file and rename it to `NordVPN.conf`. 
2. Add the location of the login file to this configuration file there is no need to input credentials.
3. Restarts the `openvpn` service so the new configuration has effect. 

## Prerequisites

It's assumed that you have downloaded and unzipped the configuration files for NordVPN servers doing the following.  

```shell
$ cd /etc/openvpn/
$ sudo wget https://downloads.nordcdn.com/configs/archives/servers/ovpn.zip
$ sudo unzip ovpn.zip -d NordVPN-Servers
$ sudo rm ovpn.zip
```

The `/etc/openvpn/login` has to be formatted just like this: 

```
username@email.com
password1234
```

It also assumed that you have `openvpn` [installed and configured](openvpn%20setup.md), of course.

## Installation

You don't need to install anywhere, you can just download it and you can run it from the download folder like any other script (`./changenordvpnserverto.sh`)

You can clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/luispuerto/NordVPN-Server-Changer.git` and then you can move the script to the `/usr/local/bin` folder so it's going to be available to everyone anywhere. Or better yet, you can create a symbolic link.

```shell
$ ln -s /etc/openvpn/NordVPN-Server-Changer/changenordvpnserverto.sh /usr/local/bin/changenordvpnserverto
```

Don't forget to make the script executable: 

```shell
$ chmod +x /etc/openvpn/NordVPN-Server-Changer/changenordvpnserverto.sh
```

## Usage

```shell
$ changenordvpnseverto coNNNN
```

Where `coNNN` is the country and number of the server you want to connect. For example `us1182`. You can see all the servers [here](https://nordvpn.com/servers/).
